This lets user’s access corporate email on their personal devices without any required setup on their part.\n\nYou can use email profiles to configure the following device types:\n\n-   Devices that run Windows Phone 8 and later\n\n-   Devices that run iOS 7.1 and later\n\n-   Devices that run Samsung KNOX Standard (4.0 and later)\n\n-   Devices that run Windows 10 desktop, Windows 10 Mobile, and later\n\nIn addition to configuring an email account on the device, you can also configure synchronization settings such as how much email to synchronize, and depending on the device type, the content types to synchronize.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Whenever possible, choose the most secure options that your email infrastructure and client operating systems can support. Email profiles provide a convenient method to centrally distribute and manage email settings that your devices already support. [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] does not add email functionality.\n\n## How email profiles are secured\nEmail profiles can be secured using one of two methods:\n\n### Certificates\nWhen you create the email profile, you choose a SCEP certificate profile that you have previously created in [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)]. This is known as the identity certificate and is used to authenticate against a trusted certificate profile (or a root certificate) you created to establish that the user’s device is allowed to connect. The trusted certificate is deployed to the computer that authenticates the email connection, typically, the Exchange server.\n\nFor more information about how to create and use certificate profiles in [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)], see [Enable access to company resources using certificate profiles with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Enable-access-to-company-resources-using-certificate-profiles-with-Microsoft-Intune.md).\n\n### Username and password\nThe user authenticates to the Exchange server by providing their username and password.\n\nThe password is not contained in the email profile, so the user will need to supply this when they connect to email.\n\n### Create an email profile\n\n1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Policy** &gt; **Add Policy**.\n\n2.  Configure one of the following policy types:\n\n    -   **Email Profile for Samsung KNOX Standard (4.0 and later)**\n\n    -   **Email Profile (iOS 7.1 and later)**\n\n    -   **Email Profile (Windows Phone 8 and later)**\n\n    -   **Email Profile (Windows 10 Desktop and Mobile and later)**\n\n    You can only create and deploy a custom email profile policy. Recommended settings are not available.\n\n    For more information about how to create and deploy policies, see the [Use policies to manage computers and mobile devices with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Use-policies-to-manage-computers-and-mobile-devices-with-Microsoft-Intune.md) topic.\n\n3.  Use the following table to help you configure Samsung KNOX email profile settings:\n\n    |Setting name|More information|\n    |----------------|--------------------|\n    |**Name**|Enter a unique name for the email profile.|\n    |**Description**|Provide a description that gives an overview of the email profile and other relevant information that helps you to locate it.|\n    |**Host**|Specify the hostname of your company Exchange Server that hosts Exchange ActiveSync services.|\n    |**Account name**|Specify the display name for the email account as it will appear to users on their devices.|\n    |**Username**|Select how the username for the email account will be obtained.
