A managed app that you install directly on a device will not work with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] and will need to be removed and then reinstalled by your IT department using [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)].\n\n## How do they work?\nWhen data, for example a document, spreadsheet, etc., is protected by managed apps, you must use a managed app to access that data. If a managed app is required (and installed), it will open automatically. If a required app is not available, certain operations, like opening a document or accessing a web link from within a managed document, might not be available.\n\n## When might I use them?\nThe following list includes common configurations and options that can be managed and that could affect your interactions with content and company resources from your device:\n\n-   Access to specific websites\n\n-   Transfers of data between apps\n\n-   **Save as** operations\n\n-   **Copy** and **paste** operations\n\n-   PIN access requirements\n\n-   Login using company credentials\n\n-   Backup to the cloud\n\n-   Screen capture events\n\n-   Data encryption requirements\n\nThe following are common apps that your IT department might manage:\n\n-   Managed web browser\n\n-   Managed image viewer\n\n-   Managed PDF viewer\n\n-   Managed AV player\n\n## Do I have to do anything to use them?\nContact your IT department for more information about the managed apps on your device.\n\n"
