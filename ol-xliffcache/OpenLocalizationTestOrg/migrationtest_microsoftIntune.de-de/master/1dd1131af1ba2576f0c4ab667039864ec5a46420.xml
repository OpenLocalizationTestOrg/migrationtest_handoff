Once users install the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] company portal app, their devices can be targeted with policy using the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] administration console.  Before you can manage iOS and Mac devices, you must import an Apple Push Notification service (APNs) certificate from Apple. This certificate allows Intune to manage iOS and Mac devices and establishes an accredited and encrypted IP connection with the mobile device management authority services.\n\nAs an alternative to enrollment with the Company Portal app, you can also [enroll corporate-owned iOS devices](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn408185.aspx#BKMK_CODiOS) .\n\n## Prepare to manage iOS and Mac devices with Microsoft Intune\nThe following steps allow [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] to manage iOS devices using the Company Portal.\n\n#### Set up iOS and Mac enrollment with Intune\n\n1.  **Set up Intune**\n    If you haven’t already, prepare for mobile device management by  [setting the mobile device management authority](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt346013.aspx) as **Microsoft Intune** and setting up MDM.\n\n2.  **Get a certificate signing request**\n    As an administrative user, open the [Microsoft Intune administration console](http://manage.microsoft.com), go to **Administration** &gt; **Mobile Device Management** &gt; **iOS and Mac OS X** &gt; **Upload an APNs Certificate**, and click **Download the APNs certificate request**.
