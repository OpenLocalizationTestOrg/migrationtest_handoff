This generally involves three steps:\n\n-   [Configure the app](#BKMK_Conf)\n\n-   [Deploy the app](#BKMK_Depl)\n\n-   [Monitor the app](#BKMK_Monitor)\n\nFor information about how to update and retire apps, see [Update apps using Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Update-apps-using-Microsoft-Intune.md).\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> The information in this topic helps you to deploy apps to [enrolled Windows PCs](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt346003.aspx) and other mobile devices. If you want to deploy apps to  [Windows PCs that you manage using the client software](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646959.aspx), see [Deploy apps to Windows PCs in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Deploy-apps-to-Windows-PCs-in-Microsoft-Intune.md).\n\n## <a name=\"BKMK_Conf\"></a>Configure the app\nIn this procedure, you'll use the Intune Software Publisher to configure the properties of the app and, where applicable, upload it to your cloud storage space.\n\n#### To configure an app\n\n1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Apps** &gt; **Add Apps** to start the Intune software publisher.\n\n    > [!TIP]\n    > You might need to enter your Intune username and password before the publisher starts.\n\n2.  On the **Software setup** page of the software publisher, configure the following:\n\n    **Select how this software is made available to devices** - Choose from:\n\n    -   **Software installer**, then specify:\n\n        |Setting|Details|\n        |-----------|-----------|\n        |**Select the software installer file type**|This indicates the type of software you want to deploy. For example, if you want to install an iOS app, choose **App Package for iOS (&#42;.ipa file)**.|\n        |**Specify the location of the software setup files**|Enter the location of the installation files or click **Browse** to select the location from a list.|\n        |**Include additional files and subfolders from the same folder**|For the **Windows Installer** file type only<br /><br />Some software that uses Windows Installer requires supporting files which are typically found in the same folder as the installation files. Select this option if you also want to deploy these files.|\n        This installation type uses some of your cloud storage space.\n\n    -   **External link**, then specify:\n\n        |Setting|Details|\n        |-----------|-----------|\n        |**Specify the URL**|Enter the app store URL of the app you want to deploy.
