For example, the alert type **Cloud storage has 10% or less free space** alerts you when you are running out of space to store your apps in the cloud. You can enable or disable, and configure properties for each alert type, for example, using the above alert type, you can configure:\n\n-   **State:** Whether this alert type is enabled or disabled\n\n-   **Severity:** How serious is this alert?\n\n    |||\n    |-|-|\n    |Severity|Description|\n    |![](../Image/Critical-Alert.jpg)|Indicates a serious issue that you should investigate as soon as possible, for example, if malware has been detected on a computer.|\n    |![](../Image/Warning-Alert.jpg)|Indicates an issue that is not currently serious, but might become serious if you do not attend to it, for example, security updates are waiting to be installed.|\n    |![](../Image/Informational-Alert.jpg)|Indicates information that is not critical to your operations, for example, a new version of the Exchange Connector is available.|\n\nOther alert types might contain different items you can configure such as the percentage of devices that must be affected by an issue before an alert is generated.\n\n**When the criteria in an alert type is met, an alert is generated and displayed in the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] admin console.**\n\nAdditionally, you can configure [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] to notify you by email when an alert is generated.\n\n## Configuring alerts\nIn the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Admin** &gt; **Alerts and Notifications**, then choose one of the following configuration tasks:\n\n|Task|Description|\n|--------|---------------|\n|**Alert Types**|Choose the alert type you want to configure, then do one of the following:<br /><br />-   Click **Configure**.
