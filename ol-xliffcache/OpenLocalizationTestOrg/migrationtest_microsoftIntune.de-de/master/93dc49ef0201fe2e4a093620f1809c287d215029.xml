You may find it useful to first understand the benefits of the Intune App SDK by reading the “Benefits of the Intune App SDK” document.\n\nThis guide walks through the major steps needed to enable mobile app management in your app with Microsoft Intune. The Intune App SDK supports similar scenarios across platforms, and is intended to create a consistent experience across the platforms for IT administrators. However, there are small differences in the support of certain features due to platform limitations.\n\n## Register your store app with Microsoft Intune\nIf your enabled app is internal to your company and will not be made available in the Apple or Google app store, you do not need to register your app. For such internal apps, the IT administrator will load them directly into the Microsoft Intune console for deployment, Intune will detect that the app has been built with the SDK, and will present the IT administrator with the option of applying MAM policy to it. You can skip to the section titled “Enable your iOS or Android mobile app for MAM with the SDK” located here.\n\nIf you are an ISV developing an app that will be made available to customers through either Apple or Google app stores, you must first register your app with Microsoft Intune and agree to the registration terms. You can supply the app’s deep link at this time. Afterward an IT administrator can apply Intune MAM policy to the app. Until registration has been complete and confirmed by the Microsoft Intune team, your app deep link will not be given the option to apply MAM policy in the admin console. Microsoft also maintains a Microsoft Intune Partners web site where the app will be registered so that customers will know that it supports Microsoft Intune MAM policy.\n\nTo begin the registration process, review and sign the Microsoft Intune Partner Agreement. This agreement describes the terms your company must accept before becoming a Microsoft Intune app partner. You will need to sign in before you can view this document. You can find the agreement in the Intune App SDK Microsoft Connect site under the Surveys tab or located here. We will also ask you to provide the name of the app, your company’s name, as well as the Google or iTunes store deep link to your app.\n\n![](../Image/Microsoft-Connect.png)\n\nWe will use your registration email address to confirm and complete receipt of the registration process. Additionally, we use your registration email address to contact you should we have any concerns.\n\nWhat to expect in the registration process: After you have submitted the form you will be contacted by\nMicrosoft via your registration email address, to either confirm successful receipt or request additional\ninformation to complete the registration. You will also be contacted when your app is successfully\nregistered with the Microsoft Intune and when your app is featured on the Microsoft Intune partners’\nsite.\nAfter receipt of the information has been confirmed, your app deep link will be included in the next\nmonthly Intune Service update. For example, if the registration information is completed in July, the app\ndeep link will be supported in mid-August.\nIf your store app deep link changes in the future, you will need to re-register you app. Also, inform us if\nyou update your app with a new version of the Intune App SDK.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> All information collected in the form above and through e-mail correspondence with the Intune\n> team will honor the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/default.aspx).\n\n## Enable your iOS or Android mobile app for MAM with the SDK\nTo enable your iOS mobile app, you will need the following:\n\n1.  Intune App SDK for iOS Developer Guide: this document will walk you step-by-step through\n    enabling your mobile iOS app with the Intune App SDK. You can find this document in the\n    documentation folder that you have downloaded as part of the Intune App SDK package.\n\n2.  Intune App SDK for iOS: as part of the Intune App SDK package downloaded from Microsoft\n    Intune, you will find a signed folder “Intune App SDK for iOS.” This folder has all the Intune App\n    SDK for iOS content.\n\nTo enable your android mobile app with Intune App SDK, you will need the following:\n\n1.  Intune App SDK for Android Developer Guide: This document will walk you step-by-step\n    through enabling your mobile android app with Intune App SDK. You can find this document in\n    the documentation folder that you have downloaded as part of the Intune App SDK package.\n\n2.  Intune App SDK for Android: As part of the Intune App SDK package downloaded from\n    Microsoft Intune, you will find a signed folder “Intune App SDK for Android.” This folder has all\n    the Intune App SDK for android content.\n\n## Turning off Telemetry for your app\nFor IOS MAM SDK Developers, the SDK logs SDK telemetry data on usage events by default. This data is\nsent to Microsoft Intune.\n\nIf you choose not to send SDK telemetry data to Microsoft Intune from your application, you must\ndisable SDK telemetry transmission by setting the property `MAMTelemetryDisabled` to ‘YES’ in\nthe IntuneMAMSettings.\n\nFor Android MAM SDK Developers, SDK telemetry data is not logged through the SDK.\n\n## Test your MAM enabled app with Microsoft Intune\nOnce you’ve completed the necessary steps to enlighten (integrate the Intune App SDK) your iOS or Android Intune App SDK, you will need to ensure that all the app management policies are enabled and functioning for the end user and the IT administrator. To test your enlightened app, you will need the following:\n\n1.  Testing your MAM enabled app with Microsoft Intune: This document will walk you through step-by-step how to test your enlightened iOS or android apps with Microsoft Intune. You can find this document in the documentation folder that you have downloaded as part of the Intune App SDK package.\n\n2.  Microsoft Intune Account: To test your MAM enabled apps with Microsoft Intune, you will need a Microsoft Intune account. If you are an ISV enabling your iOS or android store apps for MAM, you will receive a promo code once you complete the registration with Microsoft Intune as outlined in the registration step. The promo code will allow you to sign up for a Microsoft Intune trial for 1 year of extended use. If you are developing a line of business app that will not be shipped to the store, you are expected to have access for Microsoft Intune through your organization. You can also sign up for 1-month free trial in with Microsoft Intune.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions about the Intune App SDK\n\n### I found an issue with the Intune App SDK or documentation. How do I submit feedback or report issues?\nFeedback on the Intune App SDK can be submitted through the Microsoft Connect site here. You will see an option to submit the feedback or issue there. Please provide a priority for submitted issues, and the Microsoft Intune team will address them as soon as possible.\n\n![](../Image/App-Feedback-Form.png)\n\n### How does the Intune App SDK treat OS updates and compatibility?\nWe will strive to ensure that existing SDK features will work on new OS version as soon as possible, and that the SDK will not cause application crashes or other serious end user impact due to new OS features accessible to end users from within existing applications.\n\nWhen sufficient lead time is provided by OS vendors, Intune will provide support for OS Beta versions to enable application pre-release testing.

Application teams should work with the Intune team to test their applications to understand this impact.\n\n"
