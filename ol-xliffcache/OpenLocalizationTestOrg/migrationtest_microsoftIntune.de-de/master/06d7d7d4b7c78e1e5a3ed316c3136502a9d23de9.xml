From the list of service administrators, choose the user whose designation you want to change, and then click **Manage Access**.\n\n3.

You can choose from:\n\n    -   **Full access**\n\n    -   **Read only access**\n\n    Additionally, the **Helpdesk - Groups Node** allows users to choose from one of the following designations that provide custom levels of access to the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] admin console:\n\n    -   See lists of users and devices (the user cannot use filters to modify the view.
