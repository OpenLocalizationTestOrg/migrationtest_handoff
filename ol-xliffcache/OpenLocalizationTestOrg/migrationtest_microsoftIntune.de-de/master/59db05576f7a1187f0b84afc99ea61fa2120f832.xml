You are also giving your IT administrator permission to manage your device to help protect the company information on the device. Each device is added a little differently, some from settings on the device and others by downloading an app from the device’s app store.\n\n## <a name=\"BKMK_IT_can_see\"></a>What IT can and can't see when you enroll your device in Intune\nFor steps on how to enroll your device in Intune, see [Enroll your device in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Enroll-your-device-in-Microsoft-Intune.md).\n\n**What IT cannot see**\n\n-   Call history\n\n-   Text messages\n\n-   Personal email, contacts, and calendar\n\n-   Web history\n\n-   Location\n\n-   Camera roll\n\n-   Personal data\n\n**What IT can see**\n\n-   Owner\n\n-   Device name\n\n-   Serial number\n\n-   Manufacturer\n\n-   Model\n\n-   Operating system\n\n-   Company apps\n\n-   Personal apps\n\nFor more details, select the link that matches your device type:\n\n-   [Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 Enterprise and Professional, and Windows 10](#BKMK_what_happens_vista)\n\n-   [Windows RT](#BKMK_what_happens_rt)\n\n-   [Windows Phone 8 or Windows Phone 8.1](#BKMK_what_happens_phone8)\n\n-   [iOS devices (iPhone and iPad)](#BKMK_what_happens_ios)\n\n-   [Android devices](#BKMK_what_happens_android)\n\n-   [Devices Configured for Email Only](#BKMK_what_happens_email)\n\n## <a name=\"BKMK_what_happens_vista\"></a>Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 Enterprise and Professional, and Windows 10\nWhen you add a computer:\n\n-   You’ll have some software installed on your computer to make it possible for your IT administrator to manage the computer, and make it possible for you to get to company resources like apps and support information.
