This generally involves three steps:\n\n-   [Configure the app](#BKMK_Conf)\n\n-   [Deploy the app](#BKMK_Depl)\n\n-   [Monitor the app](#BKMK_Monitor)\n\nFor information about how to update and retire apps, see [Update apps using Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Update-apps-using-Microsoft-Intune.md).\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> The information in this topic helps you to deploy apps to [enrolled Windows PCs](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt346003.aspx) and other mobile devices. If you want to deploy apps to  [Windows PCs that you manage using the client software](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646959.aspx), see [Deploy apps to Windows PCs in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Deploy-apps-to-Windows-PCs-in-Microsoft-Intune.md).\n\n## <a name=\"BKMK_Conf\"></a>Configure the app\nIn this procedure, you'll use the Intune Software Publisher to configure the properties of the app and, where applicable, upload it to your cloud storage space.\n\n#### To configure an app\n\n1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Apps** &gt; **Add Apps** to start the Intune software publisher.\n\n    > [!TIP]\n    > You might need to enter your Intune username and password before the publisher starts.\n\n2.  On the **Software setup** page of the software publisher, configure the following:\n\n    **Select how this software is made available to devices** - Choose from:\n\n    -   **Software installer**, then specify:\n\n        |Setting|Details|\n        |-----------|-----------|\n        |**Select the software installer file type**|This indicates the type of software you want to deploy.
