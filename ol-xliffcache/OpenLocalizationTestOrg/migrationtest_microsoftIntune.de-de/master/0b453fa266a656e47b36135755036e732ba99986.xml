However, important updates are detailed in the **Notice** board, which is displayed when you connect to the [!INCLUDE[wit_adminconsole](../Token/wit_adminconsole_md.md)] after a service update. You can also view notices on the **Notice** page of the **Alerts** workspace of the [!INCLUDE[wit_adminconsole](../Token/wit_adminconsole_md.md)].<br /><br />When there are updates to the client software, you might be prompted to download and deploy the updated client.<br /><br />See [Microsoft Intune Service Updates](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn292747.aspx).|\n|**Back up and recover [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] data in the cloud**|As part of the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] service, the infrastructure and data that is managed for you includes configurations you make for your instance of, data and status from the devices you manage, data you upload to the cloud storage, such as software you deploy and license information, and user accounts that you add to your instance of Microsoft Azure AD.<br /><br />Data you upload for use with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] is maintained in the cloud but does not replace the need to maintain an on-premises backup for the source of that information.<br /><br />For information about how Microsoft manages your data, download the [Microsoft Intune Privacy and Data Protection Overview](http://download.microsoft.com/download/C/C/8/CC8065C4-829F-4635-B731-1D39287444C0/Windows_Intune_Privacy_and_Data_Protection_Overview.pdf) white paper.|\n|**Reinstall the On-Premises Exchange Connector**|There are no options to back up or restore this connector.
