[!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] also provides tools that help you to manage and monitor malware attacks\n\nIf you have not yet installed the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] client on your computers, see [Install the Windows PC client with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Install-the-Windows-PC-client-with-Microsoft-Intune.md).\n\nUse the information in the following sections to help you configure, deploy and monitor [!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)].\n\n## Using Endpoint Protection in Microsoft Intune\n\n### Before you start\nAs an IT admin, one of your top priorities is to keep the computers that you manage free of malware and viruses. Before you deploy [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] to client computers in your organization, you should decide how to protect your computers by selecting one of the following options and configuring its associated policy settings:\n\n|I want to:|Endpoint Protection policy settings|More information|\n|--------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|\n|Use [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] only if no third-party endpoint protection application is installed<br /><br />You can use [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] on all computers where a third-party endpoint protection application is not installed.|Install Endpoint Protection = **Yes**<br /><br />Enable Endpoint Protection = **Yes**<br /><br />Install Endpoint Protection even if a third-party endpoint protection application is installed = **No**|If a third-party endpoint protection application is detected, [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] will not be installed, or will be uninstalled if it has already been installed.|\n|Use [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)], even if a third-party endpoint protection application is installed<br /><br />With this approach, you will be running [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] and the third party endpoint protection application (if it is installed) simultaneously.

Leave your current endpoint protection application running while you deploy the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] client software to those computers.\n\n2.  Confirm that [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] is installed and is helping to secure client computers.\n\n3.

Configure and deploy a **Microsoft Intune Agent Settings** policy for the [!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] settings. You can use recommended settings or customize the settings. If you need more information about how to create and deploy policies, see the [Common Windows PC management tasks with the Microsoft Intune computer client](../Topic/Common-Windows-PC-management-tasks-with-the-Microsoft-Intune-computer-client.md) topic.\n\n    The tables after this procedure show the values you can configure in the policy and also the recommended values that will be used if you don’t customize the policy.
